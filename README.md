# Forecasting-Clouds-with-a-Satellite-Based-Dataset-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Cloud forecasts can help in weather forecasts and assist meteorologists on a more complete understanding of climate change. To this day, there is not much work on approaching climate crisis and weather forecasting by using machine learning. In this paper, we analyze a satellite captured cloud data set over Europe. All original images are in 768x768 resolution, they are taken in 15 minutes interval. We implement five different deep learning algorithms for cloud forecasting and compare their performance. According to the experimental results, the Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) provides a reliable cloud forecasting with the highest prediction accuracy.This forecasting method not only provides a new research idea for cloud forecasting but also provides practical experience for scholars to study time-series spatial data.
