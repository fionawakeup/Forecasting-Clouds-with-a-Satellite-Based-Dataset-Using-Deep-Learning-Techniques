# Forecasting-Clouds-with-a-Satellite-Based-Dataset-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Cloud forecasts can help in weather forecasts andassist meteorologists on a more complete understanding of cli-mate change. To this day, there is not much work on approachingclimate crisis and weather forecasting by using machine learning.In this paper, we analyze a satellite captured cloud data setover Europe. All original images are in 768x768 resolution, theyare taken in 15 minutes interval. We implement six differentdeep learning models for cloud forecasting and compare theirperformance. According to the experimental results, the CNNLong Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) provides areliable cloud forecasting with the highest prediction accuracy.This forecasting method not only provides a new research ideafor cloud forecasting but also provides practical experience forscholars to study time-series spatial data.
